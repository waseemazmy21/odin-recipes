    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This recipe is from my grandmother and great grandmother's family.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into 6 pieces</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium size bowl mix together the eggs and milk. Add ALMOST all of the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder (reserve a dash of each for seasoning the chicken pieces). Set aside.</li>

        <li>Sprinkle a dash of the remaining salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder onto both sides of the chicken pieces.</li>

        <li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Put the flour in a plastic bag. One piece at a time, dip the chicken into the egg/milk mixture then add to the plastic bag. Shake the bag so that the flour is covering each piece of chicken.</li>

        <li>You can check to see if the oil is hot enough by sprinkling a little flour in the skillet. If it fries, it's hot enough! Place the chicken pieces in the skillet. After about 5 minutes, turn the chicken over. Let chicken fry for about 15 minutes or until the meat is cooked through and the juices run clear. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
