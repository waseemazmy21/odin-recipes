    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Every once in a while I get a craving for a non-tomato sauce, or 'white' pizza. 'New pizza ideas' is always a popular food wish, and I hope this ricotta spread inspires lots of pizza experimentation in your kitchen.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup fresh asparagus, trimmed</li>
        <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped herbs, such as basil, parsley, rosemary, thyme (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 pound pizza dough (see footnote for recipe link)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>½ cup diced smoked ham</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 550 degrees F (285 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add asparagus and cook uncovered until just tender, about 2 minutes. Drain in a colander, then immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes. Once asparagus is cold, drain well and set aside.</li>

        <li>Combine ricotta, olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, black pepper, and heavy cream in a small bowl. Stir in fresh herbs (if using) and set aside.</li>

        <li>To shape the pizza dough, sprinkle the countertop and dough surface with flour and lightly pat flat. Use a rolling pin to form a thin disk about 9 inches in diameter. Transfer to a baking sheet.</li>

        <li>Spread ricotta mixture over crust, top with ham and asparagus. Sprinkle with Cheddar and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses.</li>

        <li>Place baking sheet on the bottom rack of the preheated oven and bake for 5 minutes. Transfer the baking sheet to the top rack and bake for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
